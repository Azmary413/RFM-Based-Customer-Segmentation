# üìä RFM-Based Customer Segmentation for Strategic Insights

## üìå Overview

This project performs **customer segmentation** using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis on a sales dataset stored in **Google BigQuery**. The goal is to understand customer behavior, identify high-value customers, detect churn risks, and support personalized marketing strategies.

By assigning scores to R, F, and M values and grouping customers into behavioral segments (e.g., *Champions*, *Loyal Customers*, *About to Sleep*), businesses can:

* Improve retention
* Personalize outreach
* Maximize revenue

## ‚ùì Business Questions Answered

* Which customers are about to churn?
* Who used to buy frequently but have stopped?
* Which segments need re-engagement campaigns?
* Who is most likely to respond to upsell or cross-sell offers?
* How can we tailor loyalty programs for different segments?

## üß† RFM Analysis Approach

### ‚úÖ RFM Metrics:

* **Recency (R):** Days since last purchase (lower is better)
* **Frequency (F):** Total distinct order count (higher is better)
* **Monetary (M):** Total amount spent (higher is better)

### ‚úÖ Scoring Method:

Each metric is divided into **5 bins** using `NTILE(5)`:

* Score **5 = Best behavior**, **1 = Lowest**

### ‚úÖ Segmentation:

Customers are grouped using combined RFM scores (`RFM_COMBINATION`) into defined segments:

* **Champions**
* **Loyal Customers**
* **Potential Loyalists**
* **Promising Customers**
* **Needs Attention**
* **About to Sleep**
* **Other**
